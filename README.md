some modified fonts for personal use
- adding a distinguishable zero
- adding the Euro sign
- etc


### Monospace Fonts

- added a slashed zero to *GNU Unifont*
  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Unifont
  http://www.unifoundry.com/unifont.html

  GNU Unifont looks like it inspired commercial font *PragmataPro*, although I haven't seen it acknowledged ... this would be a GPL issue anyway. 
  Although PragmataPro surely is nice, I actually prefer Unifont for the larger line spacing and the wider (!) range of Unicode characters
  as well as for the freedom to share it.

  GNU Unifont is a bitmap font in TTF format and is only good at 12pt. On the original page, Unix Bitmap formats are also available.

  To use GNU Unifont with MobaXterm (Windows)
  -  right-click on an open terminal window, 
  - select "change terminal settings" 
  - click on "Window/Apperance"
  - check the box "allow selection of variable width fonts" (MobaXterm doesn't recognise some monospace fonts as such, compare e.g. *Skyhook Mono*)
  - click the "change" button
  - now select "Unifont", size 12  
 
       
 
- added a dotted zero to *Lekton* http://luc.devroye.org/fonts-43679.html

  Lekton has a similar feel to Ubuntu Mono or maybe Share Tech Mono

- added Euro signs to *IBM ISO9*, *IBM PS/2 thin2* and *IBM PS/2 thin4* from http://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/
  
  These are bitmap fonts in TTF format and are only good at 12pt

  *IBM Plex Mono* (available on https://github.com/IBM/plex) is a nice, modern and complete font, however for small sizes I prefer those old fonts I've modded.
